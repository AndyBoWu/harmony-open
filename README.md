# Harmony Open

Open-participation projects for Harmony.  **Propose, rally, build, *reap!***

We are preparing the first batch of area initiatives and work items to be undertaken.  Please watch the trackers for [Issues](https://github.com/harmony-one/harmony/issues) and [Projects](https://github.com/harmony-one/harmony/projects/9)!


**Harmony Technical Bounty Program**

We launched our [$1Million technical bounties](https://medium.com/harmony-one/announcing-1million-technical-bounties-c5ea23de023d) program a few weeks ago. We’ve received tremendous support from developers and teams across the world. We want to use this Campaign to help build a strong technical foundation and ecosystem for Harmony developers, users and partners. 
We will be regularly posting technical bounties/issues on [Gitcoin](http://harmony.one/gitcoin). Instructions on how to complete the bounties will be included in the repository. The bounties will be awarded to the hunter who finishes within the deadline with the best solution.


Once the project has been completed, a pull request may be initiated in the repo specified in the project description. Pull requests will be reviewed by one of the core developers of Harmony. We also encourage you to join our *#tech-bounty* channel in [Discord](http://harmony.one/discord) for faster communication and engagement with our core-development team.

**Rewards (Harmony Bounty Tokens - HARBTY)**

We have created an ERC-20 token with the ticker ‘HARBTY’ specifically for the Harmony bounty program. Bounty hunters that earn HARBTY token will be able to convert them 1:1 to Harmony tokens on network launch. The price of the Harmony token pre-launch is valued at ~$.0068/token. However, once the Harmony token is available on public exchanges, the price will be determined by the market.

**Last but not least**

Be sure to *STAR* our [open source project](https://github.com/harmony-one/harmony) before you start working on the bounty!  **Happy Hacking!**
